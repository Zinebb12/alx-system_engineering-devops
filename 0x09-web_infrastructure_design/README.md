# Web Infrastructure Design Project

## Overview

This project focuses on designing a scalable and reliable web infrastructure to host and serve web applications. The key concepts covered in this project include DNS, monitoring, web server, network basics, load balancer, and server configuration.

## Concepts Covered

### DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is a critical component of web infrastructure that translates domain names into IP addresses. It allows users to access websites using human-readable domain names instead of numerical IP addresses. In this project, we'll configure DNS settings to map domain names to the appropriate server IP addresses.

### Monitoring

Monitoring involves keeping track of various aspects of the web infrastructure, including server health, network performance, and application uptime. Monitoring tools help identify and address issues proactively, ensuring the smooth operation of the web infrastructure.

### Web Server

The web server is software responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and serving web pages and other web content. In this project, we'll set up and configure a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to host and serve our web applications.

### Network Basics

Understanding network basics is essential for designing a robust web infrastructure. This includes knowledge of IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP). We'll ensure proper network configuration to facilitate communication between servers and clients.

### Load Balancer

A load balancer distributes incoming web traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization, improve performance, and ensure high availability. We'll configure a load balancer to evenly distribute incoming requests among backend servers, enhancing scalability and reliability.

### Server Configuration

Server configuration involves setting up and maintaining server environments to meet the requirements of web applications. This includes installing necessary software, configuring security settings, managing user accounts, and implementing backup and recovery strategies.

## Project Structure

The project will be organized into the following sections:

1. **DNS Configuration**: Configure DNS settings to map domain names to server IP addresses.
2. **Monitoring Setup**: Set up monitoring tools to track server health, network performance, and application uptime.
3. **Web Server Deployment**: Deploy and configure a web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) to host web applications.
4. **Network Configuration**: Configure network settings, including IP addressing, subnetting, and routing, to ensure proper communication.
5. **Load Balancer Configuration**: Configure a load balancer to distribute incoming web traffic across multiple backend servers.
6. **Server Management**: Manage server environments, including software installation, security configuration, user management, and backup strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Review the project requirements and objectives outlined in the documentation.
3. Set up the development environment and install necessary software and tools.
4. Follow the instructions provided in each section to configure and deploy the web infrastructure components.
5. Test the functionality and performance of the web infrastructure to ensure it meets the project requirements.
